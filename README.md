### Python 3.7.4

<b>Package information</b>
- pandas 1.0.5
- biopython 1.77

### R
<b>Package information</b>

- dplyr
- tidyr
- viridis


### DATASETS

All datasets for the analysis are avaliable at [https://zenodo.org/record/4007666#.X0qEK3UzacC](Zenodo)

### DATA FILTRATION

Data_filt.py : The python script performs the data cleaning and writes the cleaned data to a new file. This code gets rid of NAs and unknowns from the clinical dataset. The dataset originally contained 4592 samples which after running the python script were 3620. 
  - Input: The script takes input the GISAID clinical data containing all samples, along with the complete GISAID genomic data for 4592 samples.
  - Output: Two files containing filtered samples.
  
### PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS

The phylogenetic analysis was performed on the https://usegalaxy.org/ server using the filtered genomic datasets for 3620 genomes. <br/>
MAFFT was used for multiple sequence alignment with default paramteres, and FASTTREE was used for the phylogenetic tree reconstruction.

### OR CALCULATION

To generate the annotations for the tree ORCaD app was used, along with OR calculations <br/>
For OR calculations see [ORCaD](https://github.com/MountainMan12/GISAID_phylo/tree/master/ORCaD)
